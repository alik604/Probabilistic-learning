## MAP and EM
```
L(θ∣X)=p(X∣θ)
```
To find the best fitting θ you have to look for such value that maximizes the conditional probability of θ given X.

expectation-maximalization (EM), it is an algorithm that can be used in maximum likelihood approach for estimating certain kind of models (e.g. involving latent variables, or in missing data scenarios).
